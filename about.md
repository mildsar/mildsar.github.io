<p>I am a passionate DevOps engineer with a love for automating processes and streamlining workflows. In a world where failed deployments are all too common, I have successfully automated the configuration of more than 200 servers and the deployment of over 500 applications. I have also migrated systems without a single failure. Every year, I assist in running thousands of cloud deployments, ensuring they operate seamlessly. It’s been an exciting journey!

I’m a dedicated Minnesota Timberwolves fan and an avid photographer. I enjoy playing the guitar and love singing in four languages: English, Italian, German, and Russian.

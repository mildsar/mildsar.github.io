<p>I am a passionate IT engineer. Love to automate things and processes. In the sad world of failed deployments, I've been able to automate configuration of ±200 servers and deployment of ±500 applications. That is fun!

Also, I'm a loyal Minnesota Timberwolves fan, mobile photographer, and home musician. I sing English, Italian and Russian songs.
